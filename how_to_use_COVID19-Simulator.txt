(CAUTION) 
The producer of this program is Korean. 
Therefore, most of the comments are written in Korean. Please be careful when modifying the program.

(WARNING)
The program used visual studio 2015(ver.community)
Upload only source files and executables because of their large capacity. 
If you want to modify or upgrade in Visual Studio, please make it in the MFC environment. 
If you use code to create your own, the dialog box can be transformed to suit your preferences.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
how to modify this program?

If you want to modify the program, you can open the .sln file and use it.
You can open and use the .exe file.
It also exists in the uppermost position and also in COVID19_Simulator/x64/Debug/.
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
how to use?

When you open the .exe file, there is a toolbar.
Ignore the parts in Korean and use "MENU".

There are 3 choices in total.
1. Simulation_init
2. Simulator
3. Result

1. Simulation_init:
Click to display a new dialog box.
"Quarantine stage"
Sets the social distance.

Strong social distance: 10% chance of infection when an infected person comes into contact with a non-infected person.
Relaxed social disease: 30% chance of infection when an infected person comes into contact with a non-infected person.
Distance in life: 50% chance of infection when an infected person comes into contact with a non-infected person.
Everyday life: 90% chance to be infected when an infected person comes into contact with a non-infected person.

Social Population: Set the social distance level and specify the total number of people and the number of infections.
Input range is from 2 to 1000.
"COVID19 negative" (blue) "COVID19 positive" (red) "recovery" (green). Recovery does not appear at this stage.
Number of infected: Specifies the number of first infections during the simulation run. Input range is from 1 to 999.
When you're done, press the check button.

2. Simulator:
In this step, you will proceed with the simulation. 
When infected with the virus, it appears red, and when it recovers, it appears green. 
The infected person will recover after a special process in the internal code. 
Once this simulator is recovered, it will not be infected again.

The simulation is terminated in the following cases:
case 1. If all people are infected
case 2. If infection no longer progresses
case 3. If 30 seconds have passed since the simulation run
You will exit.

You can change it to re-infection if you want, or you can change the termination condition.
Please refer to README.md for this part.

3. Result:
Click this menu to exit the simulation at the point of click and show the results. The shortcut is "ctrl + x".
The results indicate the simulation run time, infection rate, recovery rate, and infection rate by generation. 
Generation selection is randomly selected in the init phase.
